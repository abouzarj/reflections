When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When I want to collaborate with others or share my repository with them
*****************************
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
because we might not want to pull changes until we are ready to share them with others
******************************
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	fork is a clone from a github repository to another gitub 
	but clone is a copy of repository that can be done from github to a local computer or from a computer to another local computer
	and branches are a seires of commits with a label insid a repository wheter it is a forked repository or cloned repository
	when we forked a repo we can then clone it to our local copmuter and use it.
*******************************
What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
	If I don't have acces to the internet and I can check the last time histiry of my remote repository and also it helps git to keep track of my local changes and github changes and combine them together
*******************************
How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
	I would use something like dopbox
	It would harder to share changes when i was ready to do it becuse dropbox would aoutomaticlly save. 
	pluse i could'nt comebine or compare diffrent versions of my work....
	It would be easier because I'dint have to learn how to use git and github:)
