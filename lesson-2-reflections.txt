What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	It will create a .git file to track history of commits 
**************************
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
	It is a temprorary area and it helps us to commit a logical change by letting us add more than one file into it and commit all of them at once
**************************
How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
	With the help of diff --stage and diff command we can compare our changes and when they mean something logical we commit them
**************************
What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
	when we want to work on an exprimental feature or a diffrent language or layout but we dont want to make things complicated so branching help us test those things
	and if they worked properly we can merge them to our main branch
**************************
How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
	Every commit refers to its parent commit so if when branching ocurs it will be the next commit so we can vizulize the breanch structur by this command git log --grph --oneline numer1_branch_name number2_branch_name ... and we can write all branch names to see their structurs
**************************
How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
	With the git log --grph -- online branch_name command
**************************
What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?
	the result is a commit to which branch that was checkedout before merging - becuse this new commit is childern of both branches
***************************
What are the pros and cons of Gitâ€™s automatic merging vs. always doing merges manually?
	It will take lots of times to always merge files manually but in some cases we have to do it manually
	like when a function have been updated with to diffrent people and git dosent know which one is the better and ...
