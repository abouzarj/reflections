What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	It will create a .git file to track history of commits 
**************************
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
	It is a temprorary area and it helps us to commit a logical change by letting us add more than one file into it and commit all of them at once
**************************
How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
	With the help of diff --stage and diff command we can compare our changes and when they mean something logical we commit them
**************************
What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
	when we want to work on an exprimental feature or a diffrent language or layout but we dont want to make things complicated so branching help us test those things
	and if they worked properly we can merge them to our main branch
