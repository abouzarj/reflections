What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	It will create a .git file to track history of commits 
**************************
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
	It is a temprorary area and it helps us to commit a logical change by letting us add more than one file into it and commit all of them at once
**************************
How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
	With the help of diff --stage and diff command we can compare our changes and when they mean something logical we commit them
